# Plate Pal

**Contributors**: Southana Saythong, Adam Earnest, Lena Sarieva  
**Project Type**: Web Development with PHP and MySQL

## Project Overview
Plate Pal is a dynamic recipe website that allows users to search for recipes by meal type or ingredients. Using a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, the website features a rich database of recipes categorized by types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.) and enables ingredient-based searches (e.g., recipes containing "chicken" across all meal types).  

The website also includes user accounts where registered users can save favorite recipes. Clicking on a recipe takes the user to a detailed view page with ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and nutritional information.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: PHP with MySQL for data storage and retrieval
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and PHP for page rendering
- **Architecture**: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
